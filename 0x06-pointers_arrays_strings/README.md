in this directory i do more of pointers arrays and strings

0- write a function that concatenates two strings.
	this function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte at the end of dest and then adds a terminating null byte.

1- write a function that concatenates two strings.
	this function is similar to the first one only that it will use at most n bytes from src.

2- write a function that copies a string.
	the function should work exactly like string copy

3- write a function that compares two strings
	the function should work exactly like strcmp

4- write a function that reverses the content of an array of characters
