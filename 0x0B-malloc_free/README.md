in this repository i take a lool into malloc basics

0-float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char
the function returns null if size = 0
the function returns a pointer to the array or null if it fails

1-the woman who has no imagination has no wings
write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
the _strup() function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string str. memory for the new string is obtained with malloc,and can be freed with free.
the function returns NULL if str= NULL
on success the function returns a pointer to the duplicated string. it returns NULL IF  insufficient memory was available.

2-he who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life
write a function that concatenates two strings.
the returned pointer should point to a newly allocated space in memory which contains the contents of s1, followed by the contents of s2, and null terminated.
if NULL is passed, treat it as an empty string
the function should return NULL on failure.


3-if you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize
write a fucntion that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers
each element of the grid should be initializes to 0
the function should return NULL on failure
if width or height 0 or negative, return NULL.
